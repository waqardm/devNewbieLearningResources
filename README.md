# Dev Newbie Learning Resources

- Self-learning coding can be difficult as well as confusing. During the course of my learning I have been collating (free) resources but never had single list so here goes.
- If you feel I have missed anything, please complete a pull-request. I will be updating it as and when required too.
- When learning, it is too easy to get confused by the noise, just try to learn the basics and the rest will follow. See the roadmap below to help you focus.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Apologies in advance if it is Javascript-heavy as it is what I have been working with most.
